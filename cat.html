  <h1>Cats</h1>
  <p>I love cat's. This page talks about cats I find interesting with facts and guide on how to identify them.</p>

  <section>
  <h2>Tuxedo cat</h2>
  <p>Tuxedo does not refer to the breed of cats but for the fur pattern. Their bellies, chests and paws are white, while the rest of their body is black, orange or gray. They are largely remembered by ther black and white fur looking like a tuxedo.</p>

  <h2>Calico Cats </h2>
  <p>The same with the Tuexedoe cat, Calico does not refer to the breed of cat but the fur pattern. They have a three color coat combination of white, black and red/orange. Depending on the culture a Calico can represent money or good luck. Japanese sailors used to bring them to their voyage for good luck. Most Calico cats are female(genetics is related to the x chromosome)</p>

  <h2>Sphynx cat</h2>
  <p>Sphynx are cats with no fur. They don't shed fur because of the lack thereof of fur. They aren't hypoallergenic because they shed dander.</p>
